# Solana Snipe Bot

A Solana snipe bot designed to help users snipe new tokens on the Solana blockchain. This bot automates the process of buying tokens as soon as they are listed on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Raydium or Orca.

## Features

- **Automated Sniping**: Automatically buys tokens as soon as they are listed on supported DEXs.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Set your own parameters for sniping, such as token address, buy amount, and slippage.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Monitors the blockchain in real-time for new token listings.
- **Secure**: Built with security in mind to protect your private keys and funds.

## Prerequisites

Before using this bot, ensure you have the following:

1. **Node.js**: Install Node.js (version 16 or higher).
2. **Solana CLI**: Install the Solana CLI tools.
3. **Wallet**: A Solana wallet with some SOL for transaction fees.
4. **RPC URL**: A Solana RPC endpoint (you can use a public one or a private service like [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beatrizmendoncadeoliveira/solana-snipe.git
   cd solana-snipe
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update it with your configuration:
   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_solana_wallet_private_key
   RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
   ```

   **Note**: Never share your private key publicly. Keep it secure.

4. Compile the TypeScript code (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Configure Sniping**:
   - Modify the `config.json` file to set your sniping parameters:
     ```json
     {
       "tokenAddress": "TOKEN_ADDRESS_TO_SNIPE",
       "buyAmount": 0.1, // Amount of SOL to spend
       "slippage": 10, // Slippage tolerance in percentage
       "dex": "raydium" // Supported DEX: raydium, orca
     }
     ```

3. **Monitor the Bot**:
   - The bot will monitor the blockchain for new token listings and automatically execute buy orders based on your configuration.

## Configuration Options

- **tokenAddress**: The token address you want to snipe.
- **buyAmount**: The amount of SOL to spend on the token.
- **slippage**: The maximum slippage tolerance (in percentage).
- **dex**: The decentralized exchange to use (`raydium` or `orca`).

## Example

To snipe a token with the address `TokenAddress123` on Raydium with 0.1 SOL and 10% slippage:

1. Update `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "tokenAddress": "TokenAddress123",
     "buyAmount": 0.1,
     "slippage": 10,
     "dex": "raydium"
   }
   ```

2. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Security

- **Private Key**: Never share your private key. Store it securely in the `.env` file.
- **Testnet**: Test the bot on Solana's devnet or testnet before using it on the mainnet.
- **Funds**: Only use funds you can afford to lose. Sniping tokens is risky and can result in losses.
